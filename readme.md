# Image Cal

Additional development tool for the DLLEE Unified LArCV Repository designed to be used with wireplane images and a calibration map for an iterative process of refining the track/shower reconstruction and the **M**ulti**P**article**ID** Network.  By applying the calibration map to obtain uniform charge meausurement across the dectector, the pixel intensity (and thus the ionization) is more accurate, leading to more accurate results.

## Dependencies

* ROOT 6
* OpenCV (3.1)
* DLLEE Unified (https://github.com/LArbys/dllee_unified)
